"""Forward-only SQLite migration ladder for Mitos.

This module defines the cross-vision schema-versioning primitive every later
vision extends: a step registry keyed by monotonically increasing integers,
applied through ``PRAGMA user_version`` and nothing else (vision §5.2.5). There
is no ``schema_version`` audit table — ``user_version`` is the atomic, in-header,
transactional version marker, so schema state cannot drift out of sync with a
parallel bookkeeping row.

Idempotent replay is *structural*, not remembered (Lesson 2): each step runs only
when the DB's ``user_version`` is strictly below the step's version, inside an
explicit transaction that bumps ``user_version`` on success. SQLite DDL is
transactional, so a crash mid-step rolls back the DDL *and* the version bump
together — there is no partial apply to repair (INVARIANTS.md MI-3).

The registry ships **empty** through V1a Phases 2a–4b: the ladder mechanism is
complete and proven with synthetic steps, and Phase 2b authors the first real rung
(the V1a schema, ``_v1_schema``) and proves it via injection — but its live
registration + boot-flip is deferred to Phase 5a (in lockstep with the
``commit_parsed_entry`` rebuild that writes the schema; WIRING_LEDGER entry-001).
So the registry stays empty and the empty ladder boots clean as a no-op that
leaves ``user_version`` at 0.

# SQLite's permissive typing, so type discipline is a property of the tables, not
# of any Python check that could be forgotten (Lesson 2). The enum whitelists are
# CHECK constraints, referential integrity is FK-enforced, and the edge kind
# matrix is a table-level CHECK — a cross-kind or dangling kill-edge cannot even
# be inserted.
#
# Each entry is a SINGLE statement: ``conn.execute`` runs only the first
# statement in a string, so every CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX is its own list
# element. NEVER ``executescript`` — it force-commits and would split this DDL
# out of the runner's atomic version-bump transaction (2a Decision 4). No column
# carries ``DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP``: every timestamp is application-supplied
# UTC ISO-8601 (MI-10). All identifiers are code-internal literals (no

# that loses rows *loudly*; they cannot reverse a successful-but-buggy rebuild that
# drops rows *silently*. So before the ladder runs against a populated graph, take
# a WAL-consistent snapshot of the DB file: restored on any ladder failure (leaving
# no half-migrated DB), and RETAINED on success — never auto-dropped-on-pass, the
# load-bearing anti-requirement (a gate-passing migration can still commit a silent
# semantic corruption, so destroying the only pre-migration image the instant the
# gates go green is a wrongful-advance, P5 Ironclad). ADRs:
# ``v1b-migration-takes-pre-ladder-db-snapshot-as-binary-reversal`` and its amend
# ``v1b-migration-snapshot-retained-on-success-not-dropped``.

    The failure-path reversal: on any ladder error the live graph is rolled back to
    the pre-migration snapshot, leaving no half-migrated DB. The snapshot is
    **consumed** — it *becomes* the live DB (``os.replace`` is the cross-platform
    atomic overwrite, truly atomic because the snapshot is a same-filesystem
    sibling). Retention is therefore a *success*-path property, not a failure one.

    The destination's ``-wal``/``-shm`` are cleared **before** the replace (the
    cutover's R11 orphan-WAL guard — a stale ``-wal`` applied to the restored file
    yields ``SQLITE_CORRUPT``). The snapshot itself (from ``VACUUM INTO``) has none.

    Precondition: every connection to ``db_path`` is closed (the caller closes its
    boot conn before invoking this).

        db_path: The live graph DB path to restore in place.

# Phase 5a registers it as live ladder step 1 in lockstep with the
# ``commit_parsed_entry`` rebuild that writes this schema. Use ``.append`` — NEVER

# a rebind would be invisible to it (2a IMPL_NOTES; §7 gotcha).
